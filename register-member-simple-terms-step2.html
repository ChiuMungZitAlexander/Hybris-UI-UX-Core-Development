                            I have read and understand the information in the Amway Business Overview Brochure, including the statement that the average monthly Gross Income for “active ABOs” in the US was $183 USD and in Canada was $206 CAD. Approximately 53% of ABOs in the US and 49% of ABOs in Canada were “active.” ABOs were considered “active” in months in 2013 when they attempted to make a retail sale, or presented the Amway ABO Compensation Plan, or received bonus money, or attended an Amway or ABO Meeting. I agree to abide by the Amway Rules of Conduct found in the Amway Business Reference Guide, which I understand are available at Amway.com. I acknowledge I will also receive these materials in my ABO Mailing from Amway.</p>
